      Connelly & Company Management LTD provides property management services in
      Calgary, Alberta. The company was formed in October 1980 as a family
      company, and remains a family company to this day.


      Al and Colleen started from the humble beginnings of owning a single
      building. Each evening, the two would go to their building to turn on
      garden hoses to water new sod. Slowly but surely, the company grew into
      the reliable and condominium management company it is today.


      Today, Connelly & Company manages around 130 buildings of all types and
      sizes. We have managed any building imaginable, from 4-unit townhomes to
      200-unit high rise towers. We have managed property throughout Alberta,
      including Calgary, Strathmore, High River, and Cochrane. We have even
      managed property in Maui, Hawaii.


      We employ 8 managers and 8 support staff, and are known for our
      exceptional service. With nearly 40 years of experience under our belt,
      Connelly & Company is proud to manage some of Calgaryâ€™s premier
      condominiums. 


      As our company moves forward, we plan to bring condo management into the
      21st century. Through intuitive and easy to understand web portals, and
      through new and exciting products, we offer the best service for our
      clients.
